  Webdriver waits

  1. implicit
  When we use?   global wait
  it gonna wait just to wait until the element will be found NOT TO BE VISIBLE


  2. explicit wait  (when the webelement is on the dom )
  Conditional wait that is going to wait until a condition is fulfilled
  if code is disabled we need to use explicit
  1. write xpath
  2.refresh the page
  3. if the xpath is now unable we use explicit wait

  Syntax :
           WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,20);
            wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());

          Can we have implicit and explicit wait?----> YES
          It's a good practice to put implicit wait in start


     Fluent wait ----> we dont  use it in industry



     **************TABLES*************

     1. table level access --> the whole table will be in a single string
     2. row level access ----> all the rows of the table will be individually printed
     3. column level access --> all the column of the table will be printed

     difference is XPATH

     if we want to fetch exact row and exact column --> //table[@id='customers']/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]
     we add the indexes
     in Dom index starts with 1

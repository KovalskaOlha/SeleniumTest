********************Selenium Class 05************************

Drop Down
Two types:

1.single selected value(just 1 option you can choose)
2.multi select value
__________
When it comes to drop down we have a class in selenium that help us interact with them
that class is  Select class;
Simple condition ---> In order to be to use your drop down in down should have Select tag

Approach with drop down:
1. inspect the drop down
2.check if it has the select tag
3.write down the locator to find the Webelement drop down

4.Declare an object of the select class
5.use methods from select class to select the desired option
---->selectedByvisibleText();
     byValue();
     byIndex();

MultiSelect Drop Down:
Approach:
1. inspect the drop down
2.check if it has the select tag
3.write down the locator to find the Webelement drop down
4.Declare an object of the select class

5.use methods

********************SwitchTo********************
1.ALERTS(the pop ups window that appears)
One the Alerts is open you can't do anything else.
You should cancel or click OK
Ypu can not inspect them
There are 3 types
- Java Script Alerts (deal with swithto commands)
- HTML based alerts/pop up(you can deal with it how we deal with another webElement)
and we can inspect them
- Window based (we can not deal with them using selenium) f.e. add file

Java Script alerts:
simple alert (it tells you something)
confirmation(ok or cancel)
prompt (prompts you to enter something)
Dealing with them is exactly same way

commands:
switchTo.alert

2.WINDOWS
every window you open on your browser has a unique code (window Handle)
when we want to switch the window we tell
driver.switchTo.window(handle)
driver.getWindowHandle();----> return us a handle(current window on which the focus is) that will be the parameter

.getWindowHandles();----> return the handles all the windows that are opened up
and this method will return us Set of Strings
new tab and new window are the same thing in Selenium
 for(w:wh){
 driver.switchToHandle(w);
 title=driver.getTitle();
 if(title==Help){
 break;
 }
 }
